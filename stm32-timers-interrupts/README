# STM32 User Interface (I2C + I/O Expanders + Display) + Memory Game

Embedded UI stack on **STM32L552ZET6Q** featuring a custom **I2C driver**, expanded GPIO via **I/O expanders**, and a simple **interactive game** implemented with cooperative multitasking.

## What this demonstrates (recruiter highlights)
- **I2C protocol + driver work**: implementing / extending an I2C driver and using it to control external devices :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- **Hardware abstraction**: extending GPIO to support I/O expanders (effective pin-count expansion) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- **UI development**: LEDs + switches + character display as a full user interface :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- **Cooperative multitasking**: non-blocking logic to keep UI responsive while running “game” logic :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Features
- I2C-backed device control and display output (character display)
- Button/LED interface through an expander
- Example game (Memory-style) using:
  - Randomized sequence generation
  - Non-blocking timing for show/repeat phases
  - Clear UI states (title → show sequence → user input → game over)
  - Report code snippet shows the state-driven approach and UI rendering calls. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Hardware / tools
- MCU: STM32L552ZET6Q (course platform)
- IDE: STM32CubeIDE

## How to build & run
1. Create or import the project in STM32CubeIDE.
2. Copy over your `Src/`, `Inc/`, and `Drivers/` from Lab 1 as the baseline (lab workflow). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
3. Build + flash.
4. Use the onboard UI to start and play the game.

## Project structure (typical)
- Drivers: `i2c.*`, `gpio.*`, `systick.*`, `display.*`
- App: `game.*`, `main.c`

## Why this matters
This repo shows I can go from **protocol fundamentals → driver → user-facing behavior**, and keep the code modular enough to reuse in later labs/projects.
